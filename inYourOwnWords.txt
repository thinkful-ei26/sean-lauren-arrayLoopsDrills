What is scope?
  Scope is where a variable can be accessed.  If a variable is declared within a function, it has local scope, or it can only be used inside that function.  If it is declared outside any function, it has global scope and can be used anywhere.
Why are global variables avoided?
  They can make programs behave unpredictably and make collaborating more difficult.
Explain JavaScript's strict mode.
  Strict mode can be enabled at the beginning of a file to use it in the entire file or at the beginning of a function to use it only in the function.  It throws an error when a variable is declared without using let or const.
What are side effects and what is a pure function?
  Side effects are when a function changes something outside of it, these are usually unintended.  A function is pure if it is deterministic and has no side effects.
